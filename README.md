### Hi there, it's NTDEV!ðŸ‘‹
I am an electronic engineering student who does dumb things in their spare time. I also have a YouTube channel where I post different experiments, and I'm also (maybe too much) active on Twitter. I also have a blog where I sometimes post things that annoy or intrigue me about Windows.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the tiny11 builder, a utility that streamlines Windows images.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach me on Twitter @NTDEV_
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him or they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my YouTube channel during the pandemic, and my first video was about upgrading every single build of Windows. It took me about 400 hours. Another fun fact: most of my work is done while I'm in bed :)

If you are an employer in Bucharest (or anywhere else for that matter) who needs someone to mess around with your computers, pick me pick me! :)
