### Hi there, it's NTDEV!ðŸ‘‹
I am an electronic engineering student who does dumb things in their spare time. I also have a YouTube channel where I post different experiments, and I'm also (maybe too much) active on Twitter. I also have a blog where I sometimes post things that annoy or intrigue me about Windows.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the tiny11 builder, a utility that streamlines Windows images.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach me on Twitter @NTDEV_
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him or they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my YouTube channel during the pandemic, after seeing a Dua Lipa remix on the BBC News (it had the news sound theme combined with the song "Hallucinate"). So I did my own pandemic project, which was upgrading every single build of Windows. It took me about 400 hours.

If you are an employer in Bucharest (or anywhere else for that matter) who needs someone to mess around with your computers, pick me pick me! :)
