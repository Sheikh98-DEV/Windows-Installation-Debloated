### Hi there, it's NTDEV!ðŸ‘‹
I am an electronics student who does dumb things in their spare time. I also have a YouTube channel where I post different Windows experiments, and I'm also (maybe too much) active on Twitter. I also have a blog where I sometimes post things that annoy me about Windows.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the tiny11 builder, a utility that streamlines Windows images.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach me on Twitter @NTDEV_
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him or they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started my YouTube channel during the pandemic, after seeing a Dua Lipa remix on the BBC News (it had the news sound theme combined with the song "Hallucinate"). So I did my own pandemic project, which was upgrading every single build of Windows. It took me about 400 hours.

Maybe one day I will break out my shell and reveal my real name :)
