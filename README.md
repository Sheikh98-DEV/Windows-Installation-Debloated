### Hi there, it's S.H.E.I.K.H

Here is a script to modify and debloat Windows installation Media.
I highly recommend using my NTLite preset after using this script to have a really debloated image.
you can remove any part of this script or edit it based on you own usage. 
it's highly commented.

USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!
